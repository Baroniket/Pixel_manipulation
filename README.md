# Pixel_manipulation
This is a short p5.js Script that takes an image and applies different styles by using p5.js shapes on individual Pixels of the image.

The Project loads an image in the p5.js preload() function.
The setup() function extracts the rgb values of the individual pixels in an image array and then renders by filling the strokes with not the simple square pixels but other available p5.js shapes viz. circle, point, arc, ellipse etc.

Paste the sample code in the p5.js web editor and run.
